## 🚀 Introduction
This repository is dedicated to the open science publication and dissemination of **Trustworthy AI research**, with a focus on *sociotechnical frameworks* that promote explainability, accountability, and compliance in AI systems.

> The first consolidated contribution of this repository is a **sociotechnical taxonomy of Trustworthy AI**, published in *Expert Systems with Applications* (Elsevier, 2025).

## 🧠 Trustworthy AI Taxonomy

We propose a **seven-dimensional taxonomy** that structures Trustworthy AI into the following core areas:

- **Lawfulness**
- **Beneficence**
- **Non-maleficence**
- **Autonomy**
- **Justice**
- **Explicability**
- **Technology**

This taxonomy enables researchers and practitioners to reason systematically about *AI system properties*, *regulatory requirements*, and *design trade-offs*.
