## üöÄ Introduction
Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), powered by large language models (LLMs), is revolutionizing accessibility and collaboration for non-technical users. GenAI models excel across various digital data types, impacting diverse populations. However, their widespread use raises trustworthiness challenges, particularly in explicability and transparency. The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture addresses these issues by integrating external, verifiable information sources, enhancing reliability and explainability. This article proposes an improved RAG architecture that leverages LLMs and Resource Description and Access (RDA) to ensure responses align with trustworthiness principles, improving transparency, accountability, and interoperability.

Additionally, this repository contains supplementary information related to the article, including test data, evidence of tests, code, and other resources.

## üìä Test Data
To evaluate the applicability of our proposed architecture improvement, we developed a dataset consisting of fictional documents detailing the flora and fauna of Europa, one of Jupiter's moons. This dataset was specifically crafted to ensure that the LLM had no prior knowledge of the information contained within, ensuring that its responses are based solely on the provided documents. Additionally, we included elements related to trustworthiness within these documents to thoroughly evaluate the system's ability to verify trustworthiness.

All the documents in the corpus have been ingested into a vector database (Weaviate). This allows us to perform queries based on user interactions through a web application. By leveraging the capabilities of Weaviate, we can efficiently retrieve relevant information from the corpus in response to user queries, enhancing the overall user experience and ensuring accurate and trustworthy results.

## üåê Application Overview

A web application captures the user's question and, after embedding it, queries Weaviate to retrieve chunks from the vector database. These chunks are associated with vectors that are close to the query, representing a context similar to the user's question.

Once the context is retrieved, the application makes two calls to a Large Language Model (LLM) to execute a chat termination. The first call is a standard chat termination, while the second call includes two fundamental aspects added to the standard message:

- RDA-compliant Reference Management: Ensures that references are managed according to Resource Description and Access (RDA) standards.
  
- Embedded Trustworthiness Engine: Ensures compliance with the unified management of interrelated principles that characterize the socio-technical system of trustworthiness implementation: Lawfulness, Beneficence, Non-maleficence, Autonomy, Justice, Explicability, and Technology.

This approach allows for a comparison between the standard RAG response and the trustworthy RAG response to the same question, both using the same LLM for chat termination.

## üîç Evidence and Results

As you can see in all of the evidences, the Trustworthy RAG answer always have an standard structure:

- Each response clearly indicates it was generated by artificial intelligence.
- Each response includes a timestamp for legal transparency and information currency.
- Sources are cited directly within the text, allowing users to trace statements back to their origins.
- Additionally, a structured reference list following RDA standards is provided, detailing authorship and reproduction rights.
- Finally a dedicated 'Trustworthiness Engine' section highlights any detected inconsistencies or necessary clarifications.

Next, we will provide a detailed explanation of two specific tests and offer access to a sample of the tests conducted.

- **Finding 1**: Protection Against Unauthorized Data Exposure.

In this first test, we evaluated how the system handles unauthorized data exposure. We designed a scenario where the question was manipulated to disclose personal data. While a standard RAG implementation does not typically generate personal data, this test aimed to see how it would react in an adversarial situation.

Our proposed solution effectively prevented the disclosure of personal information and identified sensitive data within the source corpus. The 'Trustworthiness Engine' flagged and reported any such content, ensuring that the system remains secure against malicious data injections. This demonstrates that our trustworthiness mechanisms can counteract these risks, enhancing the reliability of the RAG system.

- **Finding 2**: Detection of Implicit Biases and Misclassification.
  
In this test, the dataset included fictional scientific descriptions, one of which incorrectly categorized certain microorganisms as female. Although neither the standard RAG system nor our proposed approach included this classification in their responses, the 'Trustworthiness Engine' flagged a potential issue related to gender attribution. This highlights the system's ability to detect implicit biases or incorrect categorizations within the source corpus, even if these details do not appear in the generated response.

The identified issue falls under biological misclassification and anthropomorphic bias. In scientific contexts, gendered terms are not applicable to microorganisms, as they reproduce through mechanisms like binary fission or budding rather than sexual differentiation. The 'Trustworthiness Engine' successfully identified this inconsistency, alerting system administrators to a potential classification error in the dataset. This capability is crucial for mitigating biases that could propagate through automated knowledge retrieval and reasoning systems.
