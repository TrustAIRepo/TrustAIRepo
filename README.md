## 🚀 Introduction
Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), powered by large language models (LLMs), is revolutionizing accessibility and collaboration for non-technical users. GenAI models excel across various digital data types, impacting diverse populations. However, their widespread use raises trustworthiness challenges, particularly in explicability and transparency. The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture addresses these issues by integrating external, verifiable information sources, enhancing reliability and explainability. This article proposes an improved RAG architecture that leverages LLMs and Resource Description and Access (RDA) to ensure responses align with trustworthiness principles, improving transparency, accountability, and interoperability.

Additionally, this repository contains supplementary information related to the article, including test data, evidence of tests, code, and other resources.

## 📊 Test Data
To evaluate the applicability of our proposed architecture improvement, we developed a dataset consisting of fictional documents detailing the flora and fauna of Europa, one of Jupiter's moons. This dataset was specifically crafted to ensure that the LLM had no prior knowledge of the information contained within, ensuring that its responses are based solely on the provided documents. Additionally, we included elements related to trustworthiness within these documents to thoroughly evaluate the system's ability to verify trustworthiness.
